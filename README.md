# Peachflame Feedback Form
https://acd37-peachflame-feedback.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple proof of concept application built using Python and Flask. A simple feedback form that takes in a user's submission, logs it to the database and emails the feedback to the company (mocked using MailTrap).

New technologies for me in this application were MailTrap, Semantic-UI and Flask.
